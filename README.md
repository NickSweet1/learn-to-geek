## Decription
This application focused on creating a web page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and API.  Using HTML and CSS helped us create our wireframe of the webpage. We used an API from a gaming site. The gaming site pulls important information describing each game, how to play, how many players, important facts and the rules of the game. We also used an api from Youtube. So, that a user can look up videos and have a visual outlook on the game.

## User Story
As a user that knows little about games
I want to add a search bar to search board games
So that I can get information how to play

## Acceptance Criteria
Given I am on a gaming site
When the gaming site opens with no issues
Then I am able to search a game and the information pulls in
When I get information 
Then itâ€™s saved in local storage
When I want to see a visual of how to play the game
Then I click the video from youtube
